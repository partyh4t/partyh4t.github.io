My name is Zayd (aka partyh4t). I've been teaching myself cybersecurity and the basics of IT since 2021, going through countless courses and various certifications in my freetime. I thoroughly enjoy network penetration testing, creating bots and automation scripts in Python, and creating malware to bypass EDR and AV solutions (shoutout Maldev Academy <3).
